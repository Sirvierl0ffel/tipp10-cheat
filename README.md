# TIPP10 Cheat

 <h2>Fakes lessons on tipp10.com!</h2>
 
 <p>You can choose which results you want, from <strong>strokes per 10 minutes</strong> to <strong>error percentage</strong> and even <strong>interval between lessons</strong>. You can also randomize these parameters.</p>

<p>The random lesson parameters are calculated by adding <em>a number that goes from 0 to the specified random amount</em> to the original value.<p>

<p>The queue text field has all lessons that should be faked divided by spaces.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask questions or report bugs on my Discord Windows 7#9251.</p>
